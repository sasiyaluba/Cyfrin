## About the Project

Roses are red, violets are blue, use this DatingDapp and love will find you.! Dating Dapp lets users mint a soulbound NFT as their verified dating profile. To express interest in someone, they pay 1 ETH to "like" their profile. If the like is mutual, all their previous like payments (minus a 10% fee) are pooled into a shared multisig wallet, which both users can access for their first date. This system ensures genuine connections, and turns every match into a meaningful, on-chain commitment.
